## Bank 'Manager'

This Bank **"Manager"** is a simple bank system I made to practice with classes in Java

It includes the following methods:

* ### Account methods for:
  * depositing
  * withdrawing 
  * getting current balance 
  * the usual getters
* ### Bank methods for:
  * getting a list of bank accounts on a bank in particular
  * opening a bank
  * checking for the account holder
  * the usual getters
* ### Human methods for:
  * just the usual getters 

As seen, this project does not show anything unique or out of this world but was fun to do anyways. Learned quite a bit from it and hope that it might help anyone wishing to know how Java classes work.

Inside main there is a sample code showcasing the bank methods, except the getters, and what will fail for obvious reasons like the acciunt password being wrong or the bank accout not belonging to the person.

Current plans for the project is turning it into a console app and adding random id's to the accounts so that they have some sort of identifier
